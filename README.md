# solar_boards
The solar panel boards for the PROVES Kit. Included in this repo are the 1U sized solar panels for the XY faces of the CubeSat and the 1U Z- Endcap solar panel. 

# Features
Each solar panel implements the following elements: 
- 6x AnySolar KXOB101K08TF Solar Cells in a 2s3p configuration 
- 1x Microchip MCP9808T-E/MC I2C Temperature Sensor 
- 1x TI DRV2605LDGSR I2C Haptic Motor Drivers 
- 1x Vishay VEML7700-TT Ambient Light Sensors 
- 1x Fun Blue LED! 
- 1x 5-pin Molex 1.5mm Pitch Picolock for VSolar, 3.3V Power, and I2C connections

# Variants
The Z Face Combi design is an in testing variant of the Z- face that combines all of the interfacing for the adjacent solar faces. From there a single connector goes back to the EPS board, rather than all of the solar faces directly connecting to the EPS board as with the original EPS design. 

# Flight Heritage
*Version history for the solar boards is a little unclear, so we are going to datum the current version at V1 and go from there. 
| Version | Flights | Status |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| V1 | Pleiades - Yearling, Pleiades - Squared | Supported |
